[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meoke/whatdoifeel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meoke/whatdoifeel.svg?branch=master)

## Idea

What Do I Feel is a webpage written for Polish language users who'd like to practise the skill of expressing their emotions.

Your emotional state is detected based on the text you provide in the website. It influences input frame color.



The website is available [here](www.coterazczuje.netlify.app) or you can run in it locally (more information below).

## Technical info

- JS: Vanilla JavaScript + jQuery
- JS tests: tape
- JS bundler: Webpack 
- CSS: Skeleton

### Run locally

``` 
git clone https://github.com/meoke/whatdoifeel.git
cd whatdoifeel
npm run start
```
Go to `localhost:8080` and use the site.

### How does it work?
